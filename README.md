Hi, i'm Jeferson 
i'm 25 years old, happily(is it spelled right?) married
proud father of two(João who is 2 years old and Emanuelly who is 5 years old)
i'm currently graduating in software development, i was born and raised in Brazil.
My main goal is to have an opportunity to create features, improve my development skills
and to get my first experience on the field. I've been working on personal projects for the 
past year now, and i couldn't be more excited to begin coding :)
